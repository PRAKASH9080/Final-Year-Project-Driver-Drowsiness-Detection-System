# Final-Year-Project-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of road accidents worldwide, resulting in significant loss of life and property. The Driver Drowsiness Detection System aims to minimize such accidents by continuously monitoring the driver's eye movements and alertness level in real-time.

This system uses computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze facial landmarks, focusing on the eyes to detect signs of fatigue such as prolonged eye closure or frequent blinking. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the system can accurately determine when the driver is becoming drowsy and trigger immediate alerts to prevent potential accidents.

The solution is lightweight, cost-effective, and can be integrated into vehicles or used as a standalone safety system. Its real-time capability makes it suitable for practical deployment in both personal and commercial transportation.
